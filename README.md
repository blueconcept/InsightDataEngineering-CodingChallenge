Hi this is Thang Tran's github code submission.

Welcome to my github repo for the Code Challenge for the Data Engineering Insights program.

Please note that I had chosen to not have a src code file partly because the directory commands may be different for Windows OS.

I have also uploaded and use the associates python files within this repo.  The Python version I am using is 2.7.

The run.sh shell script in this repo should work.  In the event that it does not work.  Please run the 2 associated files
for the 2 problems.

I used Pool to parallelize the heavy computational tasks.  While a method using specific Processes may have worked better, the code to Pool is much simiplier and easier to use although with this method, too much memory could be taken up by the program.

My input directory currently has 6 files. 3 Large files of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged and 3 small test files.
